        Board(int nHoles, int nInitialBeansPerHole);
            // Construct a Board with the indicated number of holes per side (not counting the pot) and initial number of beans per hole. If nHoles is not positive, act as if it were 1; if nInitialBeansPerHole is negative, act as if it were 0.

            // If the hole indicated by (s,hole) is empty or invalid or a pot, this function returns false without changing anything. Otherwise, it will return true after sowing the beans: the beans are removed from hole (s,hole) and sown counterclockwise, including s's pot if encountered, but skipping s's opponent's pot. The function sets the parameters endSide and endHole to the side and hole where the last bean was placed. (This function does not make captures or multiple turns; different Kalah variants have different rules about these issues, so dealing with them should not be the responsibility of the Board class.)
        bool moveToPot(Side s, int hole, Side potOwner);
            // If the indicated hole is invalid or a pot, return false without changing anything. Otherwise, move all the beans in hole (s,hole) into the pot belonging to potOwner and return true.
        bool setBeans(Side s, int hole, int beans);
            // If the indicated hole is invalid or beans is negative, this function returns false without changing anything. Otherwise, it will return true after setting the number of beans in the indicated hole or pot to the value of the third parameter. (This could change what beansInPlay and totalBeans return if they are called later.) This function exists solely so that we and you can more easily test your program: None of your code that implements the member functions of any class is allowed to call this function directly or indirectly. (We'll show an example of its use below.)
