If the move can be completed, return true; if not, because the move is not yet completed but side s has no holes with beans to pick up and sow, sweep any beans in s's opponent's holes into that opponent's pot and return false.

(The ignore function for input streams is useful here.) Announce the winner at the end of the game. You can apportion to your liking the responsibility for displaying the board between this function and the move function.
